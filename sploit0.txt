We noticed from the C code that check_fail() returns within an if statement.  Since the function always returns 1
the first if option for fail will always be run.  However, we saw that if we could change the functions return
address to be that of the "print Grade = A" instruction, then the program would print the correct grade and exit.
Used gdb and viewed the contents of main to find the address of the desired instruction to return too, saw that
the buffer was 25 bytes.  Crafted string to contain 25 bytes of text, then contain the address of the actual
base pointer for the main function, effectively overwriting the main ebp with itself.  Lastly the string had
the hex address for the desired print statement in main which overwrote the return address when copied onto
the stack.
